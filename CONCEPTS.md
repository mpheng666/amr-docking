# concepts for amr-docking
# LiDAR approach
## Scan preprocess by a passthrough filter (define it a rectangular or triangular region)
## Points Clustering Method
1. Density-based (DBSCAN, DENCLUE)
2. Ordering points (OPTICS)
3. Fuzzy C-means algorithm (FCM)
4. Self-organizing maps (SOM)
5. K nearest neighbours (KNN)
- Radius parameter Îµ is diffuclt to tune
- Parameter can be auto-tuned

## Model Fitting-Based Method
1. Hough Transform (HT)
2. Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC)
- Robust method for point cloud segmentation
- RANSAC is good with dealing noisy data
- Not suitable for complex geometries

## Region Growing-Based Method
1. Variable-order high-order polynomials as surface fitting
2. Octree-based region (coarse-to-fine)
- Seed points and parameters are required human intervention

# Camera approach
1. Double target tag alignment
2. Target recognition with CV
3. Target recognition with CNN

# Chosen approach
## Scan clustering/ransac with PCL
### Method steps
1. Receive input cloud from merged_cloud
2. Convert ros_pcl to pcl
3. Set param for clustering (For example cart's leg)
4. Cluster with Euclidean Cluster Extraction
5. RANSAC plane/circular object
6. Use the returned clustered list to form rectangle
7. Draw rectangle lines
8. Find the centroid of rectangle
9. Send the location of centroid

## Controller method
# ROS navigation planner
1. Send the position of the object to movebase
2. Wait for the magic to happen

# Pure pursuit
1. Align orientation
2. Move straight with PID
3. Loop to minimize location error
- This method assumes the robot is located somewhat in front of the object

# More custom planner and controller
